# TextEditor and FileCommander for Dos (e.g. FreeDos)

Actually a pretty useful text editor for FreeDos.

Check Autoexec.bat and Config.sys for memory configuration.

Not yet optimized for performance or storage space. On my 2010 desktop it works fine with FreeDos in all available resolutions.

Currently I have stopped developing this tool, so the graphics editor and others are not ready yet.

Just try main.exe. If it doesn't work, check config.sys and autoexec.bat from the repository.

If main.exe is too slow on your compute, I can't help yet. In this case you could recompile with a different graphics mode.

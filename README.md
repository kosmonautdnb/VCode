# TextEditor and FileCommander for Dos (e.g. FreeDos)

Actually already a pretty usable text editor for FreeDos. 

Check Autoexec.bat and Config.sys for memory configuration.

Not optimized for performance or memory, yet. On my 2010ish Desktop it works ok with FreeDos in all available resolutions.

Currently I stopped developing this tool, so the graphics editor and others are not finished, yet.

# VCode a Text/Hex-Editor and Norton Commander for Dos (e.g. FreeDos)

Actually a pretty useful text editor for FreeDos.

Just try vcode.exe. If it doesn't work, check config.sys and autoexec.bat from the repository.

Not yet optimized for performance or storage space. On my 2010 desktop it works fine with FreeDos in all available resolutions.

Currently I have stopped developing this tool, so the graphics editor and others are not ready yet. It's just a fast (yet usable) hack.

If vcode.exe is too slow on your compute, I can't help yet. In this case you could recompile e.g. with a different graphics mode.
